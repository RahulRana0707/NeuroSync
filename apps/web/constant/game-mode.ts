// Standard Mode:

// Implement a move counter or timer
// Track and display score based on speed and accuracy
// Potentially add competitive elements like leaderboards

// Timed Mode:

// Implement a countdown timer for each game or turn
// Add time-based scoring
// Possibly include time bonuses for quick matches

// Zen Mode:

// Remove all time-based elements
// Focus on accuracy-based feedback (e.g., "Great match!" instead of "Fast match!")
// Potentially add calming background music or nature sounds
// Consider implementing an endless mode where new cards are added as matches are made
// Provide relaxing visual feedback (e.g., gentle animations for matches)
